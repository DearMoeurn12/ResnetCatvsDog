Data augmentation can also act as a regularization technique, adding noise to the training data, and encouraging the model to learn the same features, invariant to their position in the input. Small changes to the input photos of dogs and cats might be useful for this problem, such as small shifts and horizontal flips. These augmentations can be specified as arguments to the ImageDataGenerator used for the training dataset. The augmentations should not be used for the validation dataset, as we wish to evaluate the performance of the model on the unmodified photographs.                    \n",
